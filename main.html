	 <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm changes as the input size increases. It helps in designing efficient solutions.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the input size. For example, an algorithm with Space Complexity O(n) uses linear space.</p>
